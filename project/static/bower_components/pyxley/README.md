# pyxley

`pyxley.js` is a complement to the [pxyley](http://github.com/stitchfix/pyxley) python package. It provides a set of simple React components commonly used in developing lightweight dashboards and web applications.

## Charts & Filters
The core idea of `pyxley` is that most dashboards are a simple collection of charts and filters. React provides a common interface that simplifies the integration with Python. Specifics for each chart and filter component are supplied as props in a single master component.

## Wrappers
`pyxley` is predominantly a pattern. This allows us to easily integrate with existing Javascript packages. Utilizing React, `pyxley` provides a number of simple wrappers to packages such as [MetricsGraphics.js](http://metricsgraphicsjs.org/) and [React-Bootstrap](http://react-bootstrap.github.io/).

## Installation
Install `pyxley` using npm
```
npm install pyxley
```
or install using Bower
```
bower install pyxley
```
