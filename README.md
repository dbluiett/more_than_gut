Capstone project for Galvanize data science course


My project is "More than Guts!" using Data Science to easily provide data driven sales and marketing insights.  The focal point is an interactive sales and marketing dashboard, that identifies customer segments and utilizes predictive model to predict the likelihood of product purchase.  I utilize machine learning techniques to create and optimize the predictive models in addition to unsupervised learning techniques to create the customer segments.  To create the app interface, I utilize Flask, Pyxley, Bootstrap, HTML, JAVA, CSS and Python.  Though data segmentation and predictive modeling is traditionally applied in business cases, there are plethora of cases where these methods could be beneficial.
